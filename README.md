## Description:
ScrollNavTabApp is a beginner-friendly iOS app that showcases the use and implementation of essential UI components in iOS development. This app provides a comprehensive demonstration of the Tab Bar Controller, Navigation Controller, Scroll View, Table View, and Storyboard.

## Features:

### 1. Tab Bar Controller:
The app demonstrates the usage of a Tab Bar Controller, which allows you to navigate between multiple tabs or sections of the app's interface. Each tab represents a distinct feature or view within the app.

### 2. Navigation Controller:
The Navigation Controller is utilized to manage hierarchical navigation flow within the app. It provides a stack-based navigation system that enables smooth transitions between different screens or views. The app demonstrates how to push and pop view controllers using the Navigation Controller.

### 3. Scroll View:
The Scroll View component allows users to scroll through content that extends beyond the device's screen size. This app showcases the Scroll View by incorporating it into one or more tabs, enabling seamless scrolling and enhanced user experience.

### 4. Table View:
Table View is a versatile UI component commonly used to display lists or structured data. The app demonstrates the usage of Table View by populating it with sample data and implementing basic features like cell customization and selection handling.

### 5. Storyboard:
Storyboard is an integral part of iOS app development, facilitating visual interface design and defining the flow of screens. ScrollNavTabApp utilizes Storyboard extensively to create and connect various view controllers, implement navigation flows, and manage UI elements.
